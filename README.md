Iris - presentated to the Bureau of Meteorology, 9th Dec 2016
=============================================================

The slides found in this repo were presented at the Bureau's Python "community of practice" group on the 9th December 2016.

Whilst the slides are branded, any opinions expressed are my own (Philip Elson/@pelson), and may not represent the wider views of any other community or organisation to which I am associated.

The event co-incided with BoM Christmas celebrations, and so the additional Chrismtas based clip-art was added to lighten the tone of an otherwise dense 1/1.5 hr presentation.

Order of play:
